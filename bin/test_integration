Test the secrets-provider-for-k8s image. This script sets up a Conjur cluster in k8s and deploys a k8s environment with an app
container and a secrets-provider-for-k8s init container. Finally it tests that the outcome is as expected (for example,
in the vanilla flow it verifies that the Conjur secret was provided to the app container via the environment.

Usage: ./bin/test_integation [options]
    --docker      Run the integation tests in a docker container. This is helpful when running the test in a machine that
                  doesn't have "oc" or "kubectl" installed on it.

    --demo        Run a full end-to-end demo with the pet-store demo. This demo deploys an environment with an app container
                  that needs credentials to a DB from Conjur. After running "./bin/test_integation --demo" run "oc get routes"
                  and go to "<the exposed route>/pets" in a browser. The entry "Mr. Sidecar" should be displayed on the screen.

    --oss         Run the integration tests with a OSS Conjur deployment. By default the tests are run against a Conjur OSS deployment.

    --dap         Run the integration tests with a DAP Conjur deployment. By default the tests are run against a Conjur OSS deployment.

    --gke         Run the integration tests on GKE. By default the tests are run on GKE.

    --oc43       Run the integration tests on Openshift v4.3. By default the tests are run on GKE.

    --oc311       Run the integration tests on Openshift v3.11. By default the tests are run on GKE.

    --oc310       Run the integration tests on Openshift v3.10. By default the tests are run on GKE.

    -h, --help    Shows this help message.
