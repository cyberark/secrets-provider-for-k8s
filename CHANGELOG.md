- Secrets files are written in an atomic operation. [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#440](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/440)
- Secret files are deleted when secrets are removed from Conjur or access is revoked. Can be disabled with annotation.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#447](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/447)
- Kubernetes Secrets are cleared when secrets are removed from Conjur or access is revoked. Can be disabled with annotation.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#449](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/449)
- Secrets Provider allows for its status to be monitored through the creation of a couple of empty sentinel files: `CONJUR_SECRETS_PROVIDED` and `CONJUR_SECRETS_UPDATED`. The first file is created when SP has completed its first round of providing secrets via secret files / Kubernetes Secrets. It creates/recreates the second file whenever it has updated secret files / Kubernetes Secrets. If desirable, application containers can mount these files via a shared volume.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#450](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/450)
- Adds support for secrets rotation with Kubernetes Secrets.

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#393](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/393)

### Changed
- Secrets Provider run in Push-to-File mode using a custom secret file template
  requires annotation `conjur.org/secret-file-format.{secret-group}` to be set

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#393](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/393)

### Fixed
- If the Secrets Provider is run in Push-to-File mode, it no longer errors out
  if it finds any pre-existing secret files. This is helpful when the Secrets
  Provider is being run multiple times.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#397](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/397)
- If the Secrets Provider is run in Push-to-File mode, it no longer errors out
  if either (a) multiple secret groups use the same secret path, or (b) there
  are no secrets that need to be retrieved.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#404](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/404)

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#392](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/392)

### Changed
- Push-to-File supports more intuitive output filepaths. Filepaths are
  no longer required to contain the hard-coded mount path `/conjur/secrets`, and
  can specify intermediate directories.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#381](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/381)

## [1.1.6] - 2021-10-29

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#376](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/376)
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#377](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/377)
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#378](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/378)

  ConfigMap instead of configuring Conjur connection parameters via environment
  variables.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#349](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/349)
- Adds Helm chart option to explicitly set the Secrets Provider Job name.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#352](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/352)

  v3.14 to resolve CVE-2021-36159.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#354](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/354)

## [1.1.4] - 2021-06-30

### Changed
- Update RH base image to `ubi8/ubi` instead of `rhel7/rhel`.
  [PR cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#328](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/328)

## [1.1.3] - 2021-03-01

### Changed

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#265](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/265)

### Fixed

  `Release.Namespace` instead of `Release.namespace`. Previously, the namespace
  value wasn't being interpolated correctly because its name is case sensitive.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#290](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/290)

### Deprecated
- Support for OpenShift 3.9 and 3.10 is officially removed as of this release.

  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#285](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/285)

## [1.1.1] - 2020-11-24
### Added
- An `edge` tag is published for every successful main build.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#234](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/234)

### Changed
- Uses logger from k8s authenticator client; its timestamp format contains milliseconds precision.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#221](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/221)
- Update k8s authenticator client version to
  [0.19.0](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0190---2020-10-08),
  which adds some fixes around cert injection failure (see also changes in
  [0.18.1](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0181---2020-09-13)).
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#247](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/247)

### Fixed
- The version that is printed at the product's startup now includes the git commit
  hash instead of a hard-coded 'dev' string.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#256](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/256)

## [1.1.0] - 2020-09-15
### Added
- Helm chart to deploy the Secrets Provider Job using Helm.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#165](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/165)
- CONTAINER_MODE support for application containers in addition to init containers.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#179](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/179)
- Red Hat certified version of the secrets-provider-for-k8s image.
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#93](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/93)

### Changed
- Bumped the authn-k8s client version to 0.18.1
  [cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client#223](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/issues/223)
- The retry backoff for the Secrets Provider is now constant instead of exponential ([cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#174](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/174))
- The secrets-provider-for-k8s now runs as a limited user in the Docker image
  instead of as root. This is considered a best security practice because it abides by the principle of least privilege
  [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#95](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/pull/95)

## [1.0.0] - 2020-05-19
### Changed
- Bumped the authn-k8s client version to 0.16.1
  [cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client#70](https://github.com/cyberark/conjur-authn-k8s-client/issues/70)

### Fixed
- Fixed issue with providing complex Conjur secrets. The secrets-provider
  now updates k8s secrets using `update` instead of `patch` so the service-account
  needs to have that permission [cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s#79](https://github.com/cyberark/secrets-provider-for-k8s/issues/79)

## [0.4.0] - 2020-01-23

### Changed
- Using a new conjur-authn-k8s-client version that enables authentication of
  hosts that have their application identity defined in annotations.

## [0.3.0] - 2019-12-26
### Changed
- Using a new authn-client version that sends the full host-id in the CSR  equest so we have this capability in this project. This enables users to authenticate with hosts that are defined anywhere in the policy tree.

## [0.2.0] - 2019-09-19

### Added
- Logs
  - Logging in different log levels (info, debug, warn)
  - Capability to Enable debug logs via the env
  - More messages to increase UX and supportability
  - An end-to-end integration test

### Changed
  - Escape secrets with backslashes before patching in k8s
