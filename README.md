 the CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes runs as an init container or application container and fetches the 
 secrets that the pods require.
 
To deploy the CyberArk Secrets Provider for Kubernetes as an application container, supporting multiple applications please see the [Secrets Provider helm chart](helm).
